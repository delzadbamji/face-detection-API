# face-detection-API

This is a full - scale application where users can register and log into their accounts.

The user is then given a platform to add images from which the clarifai API can detect faces.

Once the bounding box coordinates are located, the box is pasted onto the image to determine all the faces detected in the image.

Open for PRs and issues.
